To create multi company views, you should have a reporting database for each NAV database.
For example:
NAVDatabase     ReportingDatabase
-------------   -----------------
NAVCronusProd   NAVReportingProd
NAVCronusTest   NAVReportingTest
NAVCronusDev    NAVReportingDev

After your databases are setup, you should execute the scripts in the order they are listed in 
this folder.
